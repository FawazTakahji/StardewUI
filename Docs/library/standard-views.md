# Standard Views

## Layouts

### Expander &nbsp; [:material-book-open-variant:](../reference/stardewui/widgets/expander.md)

An expandable panel with built-in behavior to toggle expand/collapse on click. The header is always visible, while the content is only visible when expanded.

Includes its own (customizable) caret sprite to show the current expanded state.

=== "Demo"

    ![Expander Example](../images/example-expander.webp)

=== "Usage (StarML)"

    ```html
    <frame layout="420px 380px"
           background={@Mods/StardewUI/Sprites/ControlBorder}
           padding="32,16,32,24">
        <lane layout="stretch content" orientation="vertical">
            <expander layout="stretch content"
                      margin="0,0,0,4"
                      header-padding="0,12"
                      header-background-tint="#99c"
                      is-expanded={<>IsExpanded}>
                <label *outlet="header" text={HeaderText} />
                <image layout="stretch 300px"
                       horizontal-alignment="middle"
                       sprite={@Mods/focustense.StardewUITest/Sprites/Cursors:Balloon} />
            </expander>
            <label text="Additional content below expander" />
        </lane>
    </frame>
    ```

=== "Usage (C#)"

    ```cs
    partial class ExpanderTestViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
    {
        public string HeaderText => IsExpanded ? "Hide Details" : "Show Details";

        [Notify] private bool isExpanded;
    }

    void ShowExpanderExample()
    {
        Game1.activeClickableMenu = viewEngine.CreateMenuFromAsset(
            $"Mods/focustense.StardewUITest/Views/ExpanderTestView",
            new ExpanderTestViewModel());
    }
    ```

### Frame &nbsp; [:material-book-open-variant:](../reference/stardewui/widgets/frame.md)

Applies decorations and alignment to an inner view.

Frames are very similar to [panels](#panel), but support customizable backgrounds, borders and shadows, and only allow a single content view. Use them for menu borders, group boxes, item placeholders, and anywhere else that content needs to stand out or be visually divided from other content.

=== "Demo"

    ![Frame Example](../images/screenshot-frame.png)

=== "Usage (StarML)"

    ```html
    <frame layout="400px 200px"
           background={@Mods/StardewUI/Sprites/MenuBackground}
           border={@Mods/StardewUI/Sprites/MenuBorder}
           border-thickness="36, 36, 40, 36"
           horizontal-content-alignment="middle"
           vertical-content-alignment="middle"
           padding="32,16,32,24">
        <label font="dialogue" text="Frame Content" />
    </frame>
    ```

=== "Usage (C#)"

    ```cs
    void ShowFrameExample()
    {
        Game1.activeClickableMenu = viewEngine.CreateMenuFromAsset(
            $"Mods/focustense.StardewUITest/Views/FrameTestView",
            null);
    }
    ```

### Grid &nbsp; [:material-book-open-variant:](../reference/stardewui/widgets/grid.md)

Lays out items as a uniform grid (AKA table), where "uniform" means that each "cell" has the same size. Can be oriented either horizontally (ordered left-to-right, then wrapping to the next row) or vertically (ordered top-to-bottom, then wrapping to the next column).

Choose from either type of `item-layout`:

- Fixed length (`length: nn`), where the width (or height, in vertical orientation) is constant and the grid wraps whenever it reaches the end of the row; or
- Fixed count (`count: nn`), where the number of items per row (or column, in vertical orientation) is constant and the grid automatically adjusts their size to fit.

!!! note

    Grids must have a size independent of their content in the direction of their orientation; i.e. a grid with horizontal orientation must have a width **other than** `content`, and a grid with vertical orientation must have a height other than `content`.

    While it might seem logical to combine `item-layout="count: n"` with a fixed-size child layout such as `<image layout="64px 64px" />` in order to create a dynamically-sized grid, this isn't how it works in practice; the size of a grid cell can only be determined based on the grid's own properties, not the content inside it. If you expect to have a variable number of rows/columns _and_ a variable width/height, use nested [Lanes](#lane) instead.

=== "Demo"

    ![Grid Example](../images/screenshot-grid.png)

=== "Usage (StarML)"

    ```html
    <grid layout="400px 300px"
          item-layout="length: 64"
          item-spacing="16,16"
          horizontal-item-alignment="middle">
        <image layout="stretch content" *repeat={Items} sprite={this} />
    </grid>
    ```

=== "Usage (C#)"

    ```cs
    void ShowGridExample()
    {
        Game1.activeClickableMenu = viewEngine.CreateMenuFromAsset(
            $"Mods/focustense.StardewUITest/Views/GridTestView",
            EdiblesViewModel.LoadFromGameData());
    }
    ```

    Note: For the source of `EdiblesViewModel`, see the [Scrolling Item Grid](../examples/scrolling-item-grid.md#ediblesviewmodelcs) example.

### Lane &nbsp; [:material-book-open-variant:](../reference/stardewui/widgets/lane.md)

Lays out items in a straight line, either horizontally or vertically.

Can align items to any edge, and supports dynamically sized items; e.g. if an item with `stretch` length is placed in a lane with other, fixed-length items, then the `stretch` item will resize to whatever width is left over.

Lanes are the bread and butter of content layout; almost any UI design can be represented as some combination of horizontal and vertical lanes.

=== "Demo"

    ![Lane Example](../images/screenshot-lane.png)

=== "Usage (StarML)"

    ```html
    <lane orientation="vertical">
        <label margin="0, 0, 0, 4" font="dialogue" text="Choose Item" />
        <label *repeat={Items} margin="16, 4" text={Text} />
    </lane>
    ```

=== "Usage (C#)"

    ```cs
    partial class LaneTestItem(string name) : INotifyPropertyChanged
    {
        public string Text => $"{IsSelected ? '>' : '*'} {name}";
        
        [Notify] private bool isSelected;
    }

    class LaneTestViewModel()
    {
        public List<LaneTestItem> Items { get; set; } = [
            new("Item1") { IsSelected = true },
            new("Item2"),
            new("Item3"),
            new("Item4"),
        ];
    }

    void ShowLaneExample()
    {
        Game1.activeClickableMenu = viewEngine.CreateMenuFromAsset(
            $"Mods/focustense.StardewUITest/Views/LaneTestView",
            new LaneTestViewModel());
    }
    ```

### Panel &nbsp; [:material-book-open-variant:](../reference/stardewui/widgets/panel.md)

Lays out and draws multiple items in the same space, in a back-to-front order.

Panels are similar to [frames](#frame), but instead of decoration, their main purpose is intentional overlapâ€”for example, drawing some text or a small icon on top of another image.

All children are given the same bounding rectangle for layout, and can be "positioned" using alignment and margins. By default, the order that the children are added is the order in which they will be drawn, i.e. the last element will be drawn over top of any previous elements, but this can be overridden by adding a `z-index` attribute to one or more elements.

=== "Demo"

    ![Panel Example](../images/screenshot-panel.png)

=== "Usage (StarML)"

    ```html
    <panel layout="64px" vertical-content-alignment="end">
        <image layout="stretch" margin="4" sprite={ItemData} />
        <lane vertical-content-alignment="end">
            <image layout="24px" sprite={Quality} />
            <spacer layout="stretch 0px" />
            <digits number={Count} />
        </lane>
    </panel>
    ```

    !!! note

        Binding the image's `sprite` to an `ItemQuality` enum requires a [custom converter](../framework/extensions.md#custom-converters).

=== "Usage (C#)"

    ```cs
    enum ItemQuality { Silver, Gold, Iridium }

    class PanelTestViewModel
    {
        public ParsedItemData ItemData { get; set; }
        public ItemQuality Quality { get; set; }
        public int Count { get; set; }
    }

    void ShowPanelExample()
    {
        Game1.activeClickableMenu = viewEngine.CreateMenuFromAsset(
            $"Mods/focustense.StardewUITest/Views/PanelTestView",
            new PanelTestViewModel()
            {
                ItemData = ItemRegistry.GetData("(O)266"), // Pizza
                Quality = ItemQuality.Iridium,
                Count = 39
            });
    }
    ```

### Scrollable View &nbsp; [:material-book-open-variant:](../reference/stardewui/widgets/scrollableview.md)

A rectangular area that can be scrolled to show off-screen content. Combines both the scrollable container, which holds the element's children, and the scrollbar itself, which is automatically synchronized with the content and shown/hidden when necessary.

Scrollable views can be used to hold simple lists, grids, or an entire complex UI with many different widgets such as a configuration menu. All [scrolling behavior](../framework/focus-and-interaction.md#scrolling) such as the mouse wheel and gamepad's right stick movement are built in, and the container will scroll automatically when elements inside the container are `focusable`.

!!! tip

    To improve discoverability, set a [`peeking`](../framework/focus-and-interaction.md#peeking) value large enough so that the user can always see whether there is more content to scroll through.

=== "Demo"

    ![Scrollable Example](../images/screenshot-scrollable.png)

=== "Usage (StarML)"

    ```html
    <scrollable layout="200px 300px" peeking="64">
        <lane orientation="vertical">
            <label *repeat={Items} text={this} focusable="true" />
        </lane>
    </scrollable>
    ```

=== "Usage (C#)"

    ```cs
    class ScrollableTestViewModel(int count)
    {
        public IReadOnlyList<string> Items { get; } =
            Enumerable.Range(0, count).Select(i => $"Item {i + 1}").ToArray();
    }

    void ShowScrollableExample()
    {
        Game1.activeClickableMenu = viewEngine.CreateMenuFromAsset(
            $"Mods/focustense.StardewUITest/Views/ScrollableTestView",
            new ScrollableTestViewModel(100));
    }
    ```

## Widgets

### Banner &nbsp; [:material-book-open-variant:](../reference/stardewui/widgets/banner.md)

Displays banner-style text.

This is most often used for ["scroll text"](https://www.kdau.com/scrollish/) as shown in the example below. However, the background is optional, and customizable; the real function of this widget is to draw text with the special "title font", which is not available as a normal [SpriteFont](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.SpriteFont.html) and therefore cannot be used with [labels](#label).

In addition to being used with backgrounds as menu titles, banners are also commonly used without backgrounds as section headings in longer vertical menus.

=== "Demo"

    ![Banner Example](../images/screenshot-banner.png)

=== "Usage (StarML)"

    ```html
    <banner background={@Mods/StardewUI/Sprites/BannerBackground}
            background-border-thickness="48,0"
            padding="12"
            text="Important Announcement" />
    ```

### Button &nbsp; [:material-book-open-variant:](../reference/stardewui/widgets/button.md)

Your basic clickable button. Supports an optional alternate hover background and shadow, although the vanilla game generally does not do this for its own buttons.

Most buttons are text buttons, and can be set up easily with just the `text` attribute. However, you can also customize what is inside the button, similar to a [frame](#frame), by removing the `text` attribute and adding a child element instead. Both examples are shown below.

=== "Demo"

    ![Button Example - Plain](../images/screenshot-button.png)
    &nbsp;
    ![Button Example - Fancy](../images/screenshot-button-custom.png)

=== "Usage (StarML)"

    **Text Only**

    ```html
    <button text="Click Me" />
    ```

    **Custom**

    ```html
    <button>
        <lane padding="8" vertical-content-alignment="middle">
            <image layout="content stretch"
                   sprite={@Mods/focustense.StardewUITest/Sprites/Cursors:AttackIcon} />
            <label margin="16, 0, 0, 0" text="Attack Buffs" />
        </lane>
    </button>
    ```

### Checkbox &nbsp; [:material-book-open-variant:](../reference/stardewui/widgets/checkbox.md)

An image that can be toggled between two states (generally, on or off) by clicking on it. The image is customizable; default sprites are used in the example below.

Includes a `label-text` property that adds text next to the image; importantly, _the text can also be clicked_ to toggle the option, which improves usability by providing a much larger target in which the click can land.

=== "Demo"

    ![Checkbox Example](../images/example-checkbox.webp)

=== "Usage (StarML)"

    ```html
    <checkbox label-text="Enable killer pumpkins"
              is-checked={<>EnableKillerPumpkins} />
    ```

=== "Usage (C#)"

    ```cs
    partial class CheckboxTestViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
    {
        [Notify] private bool enableKillerPumpkins;
    }

    void ShowCheckboxExample()
    {
        Game1.activeClickableMenu = viewEngine.CreateMenuFromAsset(
            $"Mods/focustense.StardewUITest/Views/CheckboxTestView",
            new CheckboxTestViewModel());
    }
    ```

!!! tip

    Don't forget to use a [two-way binding](../framework/starml.md#binding-modifiers) or output binding in order to receive the value of `is-checked` in your model; this is much simpler and more efficient than using the `click` event.

### Drop-Down List &nbsp; [:material-book-open-variant:](../reference/stardewui/widgets/dropdownlist-1.md)

Provides a drop-down (AKA pull-down) menu to select from a list of options.

These are better-behaved than the vanilla drop-down lists in Stardew Valley; they follow the standard drop-down design of click to open, and click again to select/close, and gamepad cursors automatically move to the selected option when the list is opened and back to the toggle button when the list is closed.

It is usually a good idea to set `option-min-width` so that the selection box does not change size depending on the length of the selected item.

=== "Demo"

    ![Dropdown Example](../images/example-dropdown.webp)

=== "Usage (StarML)"

    ```html
    <dropdown options={Weapons}
              option-format={Format}
              option-min-width="200"
              selected-option={<>SelectedWeapon} />
    ```

=== "Usage (C#)"

    ```cs
    enum WeaponType { Sword, Club, Dagger, Slingshot, Special }

    partial class DropDownTestViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
    {
        public Func<WeaponType, string> Format { get; } = wt => wt switch
        {
            WeaponType.Sword => "Slashy",
            WeaponType.Club => "Smashy",
            WeaponType.Dagger => "Stabby",
            WeaponType.Slingshot => "Stretchy",
            _ => "Banana"
        };

        public IReadOnlyList<WeaponType> Weapons { get; } =
            Enum.GetValues<WeaponType>();

        [Notify] private WeaponType selectedWeapon;
    }

    void ShowDropDownExample()
    {
        Game1.activeClickableMenu = viewEngine.CreateMenuFromAsset(
            $"Mods/focustense.StardewUITest/Views/DropDownTestView",
            new DropDownTestViewModel());
    }
    ```

!!! info "Option Types"

    Drop-down lists in [StarML](../framework/starml.md) use a special, dynamically-typed wrapper over the generic [DropDownList](../reference/stardewui/widgets/dropdownlist-1.md) which enables it to adjust to any option type; the example above defines a completely new option named `WeaponType`.

    In order for this to work, **all option-related properties must use the same type.** These properties are the ones shown above: `options`, `option-format` and `selected-option`. Any type can be used for all three, as long as the entire view model is consistent.

### Image &nbsp; [:material-book-open-variant:](../reference/stardewui/widgets/image.md)

Draws a [Sprite](../reference/stardewui/graphics/sprite.md). Functionally very similar to interacting with the [SpriteBatch](https://docs.monogame.net/api/Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.SpriteBatch.html), but significantly more streamlined for use in UI layouts:

- Built-in [9-slice scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-slice_scaling); simply set the edge lengths on the input sprite.
- Has multiple [fit](../reference/stardewui/widgets/image.md) options; choose whether the image should be scaled uniformly to fit inside the layout area ([letterboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterboxing_(filming)) or [pillarboxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillarbox)), covering the layout area ([clipping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(computer_graphics))) or stretched non-uniformly across the area.
- Shadows, tint, alignment, uniform rotation and other quality-of-life features.

Static images are usually bound to some [sprite asset](../getting-started/adding-ui-assets.md#adding-sprites), as shown in the example below. For dynamic images, several common [implicit conversions](../framework/starml.md#type-conversions) are available.

=== "Demo"

    ![Image Example](../images/screenshot-image.png)

=== "Usage (StarML)"

    ```html
    <image layout="stretch content"
           sprite={@Mods/focustense.StardewUITest/Sprites/Cursors:TrainFront} />
    ```

### Keybind &nbsp; [:material-book-open-variant:](../reference/stardewui/widgets/keybinding/keybindview.md)

Displays the current, non-editable value of a single SMAPI `Keybind`.

Requires a `sprite-map` in order to display correctly. The shipped version of StardewUI includes a built-in map asset, shown below; it can either be used without any arguments (i.e. ending in `/Buttons`) or with an argument list in the following format:

`keyboardTheme-mouseTheme-sliceScale`.

Valid values for either theme are `dark`, `light`, `stardew` (orange) or `default` which behaves the same as `stardew`. Controller buttons are always shown in a dark style.

For `sliceScale`, smaller numbers make the border edges thinner; for a `button-height` of 64px, a scale of `0.5` is typically good. Adjust to preference; typically, the smaller the button is, the smaller the ideal scale should be.

=== "Demo"

    ![Keybind Example](../images/screenshot-keybinds.png)

=== "Usage (StarML)"

    ```html
    <keybind button-height="64"
             sprite-map={@Mods/StardewUI/SpriteMaps/Buttons:default-default-0.5}
             empty-text="Not set"
             keybind={Hotkey} />
    ```

=== "Usage (C#)"

    ```cs
    class KeybindTestViewModel
    {
        public Keybind Hotkey { get; set; } =
            new(SButton.LeftStick, SButton.ControllerA);
    }

    void ShowKeybindExample()
    {
        Game1.activeClickableMenu = viewEngine.CreateMenuFromAsset(
            $"Mods/focustense.StardewUITest/Views/KeybindTestView",
            new KeybindTestViewModel());
    }
    ```

    Note: The example image shows two appearances, one for keyboard bindings and one for controllers. The example code will only produce one, but both images are produced from the exact same view, populated with different keybind values.

### Keybind Editor &nbsp; [:material-book-open-variant:](../reference/stardewui/widgets/keybinding/keybindlisteditor.md)

An editable version of the [keybind](#keybind) view supporting the same options, except taking a `keybind-list` instead of a `keybind` for adding multiple bindings. Includes built-in overlay to capture input when adding/changing a binding.

Although it is designed to work with multiple keybindings (SMAPI `KeybindList`), the behavior can be adjusted to work with only a single keybinding or even a single button, by changing the `editable-type` property (see [KeybindType](../reference/stardewui/widgets/keybinding/keybindtype.md) for details). If no `editable-type` is specified, the binding cannot be edited. When the value is `MultipleKeybinds`, as shown below, the overlay includes an "add" button whose text can be customized with the `add-button-text` attribute.

=== "Demo"

    ![Keybind Editor Example](../images/example-keybindeditor.webp)

=== "Usage (StarML)"

    ```html
    <keybind-editor button-height="64"
                    sprite-map={@Mods/StardewUI/SpriteMaps/Buttons:default-default-0.5}
                    editable-type="MultipleKeybinds"
                    add-button-text="Add"
                    empty-text="Not set"
                    focusable="true"
                    keybind-list={<>Keybinds} />
    ```

=== "Usage (C#)"

    ```cs
    partial class KeybindListTestViewModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
    {
        [Notify]
        private KeybindList keybinds = new(
            new Keybind(SButton.LeftControl, SButton.F5),
            new Keybind(SButton.LeftStick, SButton.ControllerA));
    }

    void ShowKeybindEditorExample()
    {
        Game1.activeClickableMenu = viewEngine.CreateMenuFromAsset(
            $"Mods/focustense.StardewUITest/Views/KeybindEditorTestView",
            new KeybindListTestViewModel());
    }
